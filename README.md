# Korora Downloader

Korora does not have lots of money backing it, we're a volunteer-based community with the core developers picking up incurred costs.

As a result, Korora relies on free download services such as SourceForge and some sponsorship from Digital Ocean.

Some users are reporting that downloading Korora is too slow.

This is a script which uses the wonderful aria2 program to download Korora from multiple mirrors at once, which should dramatically increase the download speed.

## Dependencies for using the script

This script only works on Linux and you need the aria2 program installed.

Arch:

```bash
sudo pacman -S aria2
```

Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install aria2
```


Fedora/CentOS:

```bash
sudo dnf install aria2
```

Gentoo:

```bash
sudo emerge -av aria2
```

openSUSE

```bash
sudo zypper in aria2
```

## Using the script

All you need to do is run the script! By default it will download the 64bit GNOME desktop, however you can change this by passing options to script.

See help for details:

```bash
$ bash ./get_korora.sh --help
